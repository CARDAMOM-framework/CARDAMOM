# WHAT's NEW


Keeping track of recent updates relevant to users and developers

### EDC refactor on March 21, 2022:

See MODEL_INFO_1005.c and MODEL_INFO_1100.c
Stepwise and binary non-inf starting points now options available for each model ID
Recommendation: 
- for models with continuous EDCs, use "MODEL_INFO_1100.c" appraoch (binary search for non-inf start points)
- for models with binary EDCs, use "MODEL_INFO_1005.c" appraoch (stepwise search for non-inf start points)
