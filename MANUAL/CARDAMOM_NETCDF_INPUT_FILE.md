# CARDAMOM Netcdf input file

## Summary

The CARDAMOM netcdf input file is a "one-stop shop" for all inputs required to configure CARDAMOM including:
- Model structure choice (Model ID [add link here])
- Forcing data required by model structure (met data, burned area, latitude)
- Observations (datasets, time varying uncertainties, and other cost function options)
- MCMC options
- Minimal ancillary non-functional data (these are optional: includes longitude, notes, etc.)


## Variable names, definitions and conventions

- SOM: soil organic matter pool in DALEC. It does not include fine litte and coarse woody debris.
- DOM: sum of all dead organic C states, including fine litter ("Litter"), coarse woody debris ("CWD") and soil organic matter ("SOM")



## FAQ
### Q: If Iâ€™m not assimilating an observation, can I just delete the corresponding OBS field my cbf.nc file, or do I have to keep it and put NaN in the corresponding subsets?
Answer: you can delete it
